            As a countinous learner, developer, and student I also enjoy the following:

            Photography allows me to get out of my comfort zone and travel to experience new areas and environments I've never experienced before.<br>
            It allows me to capture moments and emotions from a different perspective.

        <h2>
            Active
        </h2>

        <p>
            Constantly being active gives my mind a chance to be distracted from the weight of the world<br> while also focus on team building and personal skill/gains.
